# Approch
    1. I have created a HTML file containing a basic code like putting the length of password we want, how many charater, digit and special charter needed. buttons for genrating password and hash password and clear that input blocks.

    2. Then i have added some CSS to the HTML document to make some what attractive, i dont know much CSS so, i have added how much i know.

    3. After that created a Javascript file containg some string fucntion, taking input convert it into int and some string opeations, after that i defined a SHA256 algorigthm which i have found in mozila documentaion which takes the genrated password as input and hash the password using SHA256 algo and return the result.
